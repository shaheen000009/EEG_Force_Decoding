# Step 1 Load EEG data
Load the EEG data into the analysis software, ensuring it is in a compatible format.
# Step 2 Re-Reference to Mastoids (optional)
If necessary, re-reference the EEG data to improve signal quality, which may involve changing the reference electrode.
# Step 3 Downsample
# Step 4 Remove Line Noise 
# Step 5 Low Pass Filter and High Pass Filter
# Step 6 Remove bad data and bad Channels
# Step 7 Apply ICA
Use methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) to separate the signal into independent components and remove artifacts.
# Step 8 Re- Reference ( Average)
Re-reference the EEG data to the average of all channels to improve signal quality.
# Step 9 Extract Epochs
Extract specific time segments of interest from the EEG data.
# Step 10 Time-Frequency Analysis
Perform time-frequency analysis on the extracted epochs to examine the frequency content of the EEG signal over time.
